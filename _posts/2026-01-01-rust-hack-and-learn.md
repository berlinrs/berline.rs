Departing from our biweekly schedule, the Hack & Learn Meetup will not take place on January 1, 2026.
The next meetup will be held on January 15, 2026.


Here are some ideas if you don't know what to hack on meanwhile:

- Install Rust [https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html "https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html") .
- Read the Rust book [https://doc.rust-lang.org/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/ "https://doc.rust-lang.org/")
- Complete Rustlings (a great beginners course!) [https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings "https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings")
