In 2016, the Berlin Rust community, together with friends from [rust.cologne](https://rust.cologne) and the Kyiv community started the first European Rust conference. See the link for details on speakers and videos. RustFest happens every half year.

Berline.rs continue to be part of the organisation of subsequent events.
